# Where to look?
The java files are in the 'src' folder. The main method is contained in the FASTA_Parser.java file and is associated class file is cotained in DNA.java

# What does this program do?
This program will import a fasta file or .txt file, parse out the sequence ID with its associated DNA sequence, and allow the user to retrieve a DNA sequence by entering in the appropriate sequence ID. If they misspell or enter a sequence ID that is not in the fasta file, the program will throw an error message. The program will continue to prompt the user for a sequence ID until they enter "quit".

# Notes
You can find a sample file to use in the 'src' folder called 'seq.fasta.txt'
